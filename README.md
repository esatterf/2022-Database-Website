# Pokemon Team Manager

## What is this
This is my final from my database design for web class where I made a website that connects to an sql database to upload and retreive Pokemon teams submitted by users

## Where to see it
This is just the code the database connection information has been removed prior to uploading. You can find a live website hosted at https://esatterf.w3.uvm.edu/cs148/live-final/teams.php however I do not know how long it will remain live as I have since graduated from UVM
