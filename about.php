	<h2>About page</h2>
	<p>Iâ€™ve been playing the Pokemon video games competitively since 2015 and have gotten decently good at it in the process. Pokemon teams can have up to six members all with their own stats, attacks, items, 	and more. With there being over one thousand Pokemon the team possibilities are virtually endless and as a result someone like me who has been playing for over seven years has a lot of teams to manage.</p>
	<p>This website exists so that I can submit teams in a text based in order to manage them better as well as have a list of teams shared online between devices.</p>
